    <p>At SwiftVPN, we prioritize your privacy and aim to provide a secure and anonymous browsing experience. Our service utilizes OpenVPN technology, offering both TCP and UDP connection protocols.</p>

    <p><strong>What are TCP and UDP?</strong></p>
    <p><span>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data over a network, whereas UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol that offers faster transmission but may not guarantee delivery.</span></p>
