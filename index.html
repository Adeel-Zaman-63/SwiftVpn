    <p>At SwiftVPN, we prioritize your privacy and aim to provide a secure and anonymous browsing experience. Our service utilizes OpenVPN technology, offering both TCP and UDP connection protocols.</p>

    <p><strong>What are TCP and UDP?</strong></p>
    <p><span>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data over a network, whereas UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol that offers faster transmission but may not guarantee delivery.</span></p>

    <p><strong>Information We Collect:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><span>We do not retain any personal user data except minimal device information necessary for sending notifications. This includes device identifiers or push notification tokens provided by services like OneSignal.</span></li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Why Notification Services are Important:</strong></p>
    <p><span>Notifications are crucial for informing users about updates, service changes, or any critical information regarding their VPN usage. We utilize notification tokens to send necessary updates related to SwiftVPN services via OneSignal.</span></p>

    <p><strong>User Responsibilities:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><span>User Accountability: Users are solely responsible for their actions while using SwiftVPN. Any misuse or illegal activities conducted through our service are the sole responsibility of the user.</span></li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Data Retention:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><span>We retain minimal device information strictly for the purpose of providing notification services. This data is not used for any other purposes and is stored only as long as necessary to deliver notifications.</span></li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Data Security:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><span>We implement robust security measures to safeguard the limited data collected from unauthorized access or misuse.</span></li>
    </ol>
